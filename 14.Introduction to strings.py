"""
Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single or kdouble quotes

'hello'
"Hello"


Strings are ordered sequences it means we can using indexing and slicing to grab sub-section of the string

indexing notation uses [] notation after the string
indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string


0 1 2 3 4
h e l l o


0 -4 -3 -2 -1
h  e  l  l  o

Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a slice of the string.
this has the following syntax

[start: stop : step]

start is a numerical index for the slice start
stop is the index you will  go up to
step is the size of the jump you take


"""
print ("hello")
print('hello')

print ("I'm going to home")
print ("Bye, \n I'm going to home")

print("hello \t world")

print (len("hello"))
